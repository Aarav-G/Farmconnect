INTRODUCTION:

The purpose of this project is to build an application to enable farmers and
customers to make sale transactions efficiently. Ridden by various scams over
time, the plight of the Indian farmer has only been getting worse. As a result, it
is now essential to link farmers with customers directly, cutting out the
middlemen from the equation. This is why our effort is focused in this direction.
By cutting out the middleman and ensuring that both the farmer and the buyer
enjoy a flawless transaction whether purchasing or selling goods at a fair and
acceptable price, FarmConnect benefits both the farmer and the customer.
FarmConnect supports the transformation of the agriculture industry

OBJECTIVES:

The web-application provides a multilingual platform for the users. This will
help the user to use the app in the language he/she is comfortable with.
The web-application also aims to recommend the type of crops to be grown in
the specific season to the farmer based on various factors.
The web-application will also help farmers to identify the crop-disease using the
crop disease functionality of the system.
It will serve as a log of income for the farmer, which can be used as a proof to
banks while availing loans.
The platform will act as an interface that gives a higher priority to the farmers
who are nearer to the customer location.
